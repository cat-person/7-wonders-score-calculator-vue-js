# 7 Wonders Score Calculator

Welcome to my score calculator for the board game [7 Wonders (2nd Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316377/7-wonders-second-edition).
If you are only interested in the web page, -- it is published on github at the [following link](https://cat-person.github.io/7W)

## Technical Description
This project is written using `vue.js` and includes:
* a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices 
* working with a remote server (`appwrite.io is` used as a backend)
* navigation via `vue-router`
* image carousel via `embla-carousel-vue`
* localization via `i18n`
* longpress processing

## Contribution 
I tried to write the code in as simple a way as possible and consider it beginner friendly. You can help the project by:
* providing localization files (currently there are only English and Russian translations) 
* replacing the existing images for wonders with better art
* introducing error handling when interacting with the backend (currently the app only handles the happy path)
* improving the code in general (I'm not very good at web development, so there are some rough spots here and there in the app code)
